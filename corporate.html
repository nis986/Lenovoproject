Lenovo's registered office is in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong
Alongside Beijing, the company has operational centres in Lorong Chuan, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina[162][163] (near Raleigh in the Research Triangle metropolitan area)[164] in the United States.[165] As of October 2012, the Morrisville facility has about 2,000 employees.[166] Lenovo identifies its facilities in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville as its "key location addresses",[167] where its principal operations occur.[162] The company's registered office is on the 23rd floor of the Lincoln House building of the Taikoo Place in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.[168]

Previously the company's U.S. headquarters were in Purchase, Harrison, New York. About 70 people worked there. In 2006, Lenovo announced that it was consolidating its U.S. headquarters, a logistics facility in Boulder, Colorado, and a call center in Atlanta, to a new facility in Morrisville. The company received offers of over $11 million in incentive funds from the local Morrisville, North Carolina, area and from the State of North Carolina on the condition that the company employs about 2,200 people.[169] In early 2016, Lenovo carried out a comprehensive restructuring of its business units.[170]

<b>Ownership</b><br>
In 2009, China Oceanwide Holdings Group, a private Investment company based in Beijing, bought 29% of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo, for ¥2.76 billion.[175] As of 31 March 2018, 65% of Lenovo stock was held by the general public, 29% by Legend Holdings, 5.8% by Yang Yuanqing, and 0.2% by other directors.[176]

Responding to claims that Lenovo is a state-owned enterprise, CEO Yang Yuanqing said, "Our company is a 100% market oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team."[177]

As of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, owns 11.7% of Lenovo and IBM owns 37.8%.[178]

In early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, "We are not a government-controlled company." He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.[179] The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.

Yang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, "While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership – we do what we say, and we own what we do. My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles."[180]

Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO
Yang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, Bloomberg Businessweek named him one of Asia's rising stars in business.[181] Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's Stephen M. Ward, Jr. Ward was succeeded by William Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.

In 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, "redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done." Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, "felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company".[182] The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of ¥2,000 RMB or about US$314. This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China.[183] Yang made a similar gift of US$3.25 million again in 2013.[184]

According to Lenovo's annual report, Yang earned US$14 million, including US$5.2 million in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.[185]

In 2013, Barron's named Yang one of the "World's Best CEOs".[186]

Main article: Liu Chuanzhi
Liu Chuanzhi is the founder and former chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with The Economist he stated that "Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard." For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[187] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, "I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible."[14]

<b>Board of directors</b><br>
In early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board.[188] Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, "Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company." Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, "We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era."
