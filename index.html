   Lenovo was founded in Beijing on 1 November 1984 as <b>Legend</b> by a team of engineers led by Liu Chuanzhi and Danny Lui.[10] Initially specializing in televisions, the company migrated towards manufacturing and marketing computers. Lenovo grew to become the market leader in China and raised nearly US$ 30 million in an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Since the 1990s, Lenovo has increasingly diversified from the personal computer market and made a number of corporate acquisitions, with the most notable being acquiring and integrating most of IBM's personal computer business and its x86-based server business as well as creating its own smartphone.[11]

Lenovo has operations in over 60 countries and sells its products in around 180+ countries.[citation needed] It was incorporated in Hong Kong,[1] with global headquarters in Beijing, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States.[2][3] and operational centres in Singapore and Morrisville, North Carolina, US. It has research centres in Beijing, Chengdu, Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan), Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Morrisville,[4] and also has Lenovo NEC Holdings, a joint venture with NEC that produces personal computers for the Japanese market.
